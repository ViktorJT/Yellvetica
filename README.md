# Yellvetica

https://viktorjt.github.io/Yellvetica/

The only font designed for insensible online debate. 

# Why?

Yellvetica is the clear choice for any web-project looking to curate a vile and graceless community of un-likeminded individuals.

Demonstrably influence community engagement KPIs like 'Time-To-Yell' (TTY; for short): allowing mere moments of peace before cooking up a bad-vibe battle-royal.

Break constructive discourse with ill constructed sticks and stones, today.

# How?

As the un-official stepdad of the beloved Helvetica typeface; Yellvetica speaks only in imperative sentences. 

Bye-bye, meticulously designed lowercase characters and punctuation. 
Hello, alpha-male uppercase and exclamation points.
