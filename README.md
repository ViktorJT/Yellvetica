# Yellvetica

The only font needed for insensible online debate. 

The clear choice of any web-project needing a font that is as obtuse, graceless and aggressive as todays commentboards.

Yellvetica is a quick hack of the classic font helvetica that omits all lowercase and punctuation in favor for bold uppercase and exclamation points, effortlessly articulating nothing but imperative sentences so you don't have to!

Yellvetica has the same no-nonsense design of Helvetica, but provides much needed validity to even the most demonstrably false statements crafted by your users unhinged imagination.

'I read a small part of a medium article and now harbour large opinions!'
- typical yellvetica user

I suspect this font will revolutionize the 'Time-To-Yell' (or TTY, for short) required before a yellvetica user inevitably bullies their antagonist into a Ouroboros-esque screaming match.
